# coily

Simulate values using spring physics.

Coily animates numbers — and whole numeric shapes — with damped spring motion. Each frame is computed from the closed-form solution of the spring equation — underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped — rather than numerical integration, so motion doesn't accumulate error and springs can be retargeted mid-flight without losing momentum.

The core has zero dependencies and runs anywhere (it falls back from `requestAnimationFrame` to `setTimeout` outside the browser). Vue and Nuxt integrations ship as separate entry points; `vue` and `@nuxt/kit` are optional peer dependencies.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add coily
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { createSpringSystem, defineSpring } from 'coily'

const system = createSpringSystem()
system.start()

const spring = system.createSpring(0, defineSpring({ tension: 500, damping: 40 }))

spring.onUpdate(() => {
  ball.style.setProperty('--x', String(spring.value))
})

// Animate toward a new target at any time. Position and velocity
// carry over, so interruptions look natural.
spring.target = 300
```

## Configuring springs

`defineSpring` accepts several input shapes; whatever you leave out is derived:

```ts
defineSpring({ tension: 500, damping: 40 }) // direct physical parameters
defineSpring({ tension: 500, dampingRatio: 0.7 }) // damping derived
defineSpring({ tension: 500, bounce: 0.3 }) // bounce = 1 - dampingRatio
defineSpring({ duration: 750, dampingRatio: 1 }) // tuned to settle in ~750ms
defineSpring({ duration: 750, bounce: 0.5 })
```

- **`tension`** — stiffness (> 0)
- **`damping`** — friction (≥ 0)
- **`dampingRatio`** — 0 = undamped, < 1 = bouncy, 1 = critically damped, > 1 = overdamped
- **`bounce`** — friendlier alias for damping ratio: −1 (overdamped) to 1 (max bounce)
- **`duration`** — target settle time in ms. Assumes an initial displacement of 1; pass `displacement` matching your animation range for accurate timing
- **`mass`** — defaults to 1
- **`precision`** — decimal places of the resting threshold (default 2). A spring is _resting_ once its remaining motion cannot reach half a unit in the last place — 0.005 at the default. Values are never rounded; set precision to match your domain's resolution (see [PRECISION.md](https://github.com/tkofh/coily/blob/main/PRECISION.md))

Without a config, springs are critically damped with a ~500ms settle time.

## Spring API

- `spring.target` — set to animate toward a new value
- `spring.value` — current value; writable to displace the spring
- `spring.velocity` — current velocity; writable to fling
- `spring.jumpTo(v)` — snap to a value with no animation
- `spring.config` — assign a new `SpringDefinition`, or `null` to revert to the default (or the leader's, if following)
- `spring.isResting`, `spring.timeRemaining` — settle state and estimated ms until rest
- `spring.settled` — a promise that resolves when the spring next comes to rest (immediately if already resting). Retargeting mid-flight extends the wait; disposing resolves it. `await spring.settled` to sequence animations
- `spring.onUpdate(cb)` / `onStart(cb)` / `onStop(cb)` / `onDispose(cb)` — subscribe; each returns an unsubscribe function. `start` fires when the spring leaves rest, `stop` when it settles — the two always alternate, and retargeting mid-flight fires neither
- `spring.dispose()` — release the spring (calling it twice is a no-op)

### Chaining

A spring can follow another spring's live value instead of a fixed number, and `mapSpring` derives new followable values from existing ones — offsets, mirrors, clamps, any pure function of the value:

```ts
const leader = system.createSpring(0)

const follower = system.createSpring(leader.value)
follower.target = leader

const trailing = system.createSpring(leader.value + 20)
trailing.target = mapSpring(leader, (v) => v + 20)

const mirrored = system.createSpring(-leader.value)
mirrored.target = mapSpring(leader, (v) => -v)
```

Followers inherit the leader's config unless given their own. Assigning a number to `target` unfollows.

`mapSpring` also combines several springs: pass a shape — a plain object or array with springs at the leaves, nested arbitrarily — and a function of their values. Several springs leave no single config to inherit, so a third argument states what the derived value offers followers: a `SpringDefinition`, or `null` to offer none (followers fall back to their default). The same argument is optional on single-spring maps, replacing the pass-through:

```ts
const x = system.createSpring(0)
const y = system.createSpring(0)

const distance = system.createSpring(0)
distance.target = mapSpring({ x, y }, ({ x, y }) => Math.hypot(x, y), null)
```

A mapped value is a `SpringSource` — the interface every `Spring` implements and the contract `target` accepts. It's an open contract: any object honoring it (a pointer position, a scroll offset) can be followed directly, and can sit at the leaves of a `mapSpring` shape.

### Objects

`createSpring` also takes any numeric shape — a plain object or array whose leaves are all numbers, nested arbitrarily. Each leaf becomes an independent channel behind one composite API:

```ts
const spring = system.createSpring({ position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, opacity: 1 })

spring.target = { position: { x: 100 } } // partial — other channels are left alone
spring.value // { position: { x, y }, opacity } — a stable, read-only mirror
```

The shape is fixed at creation, and unknown channels throw with their path (`position.z`). `value`, `velocity`, and `jumpTo` take the same partial shapes. Composite events are coalesced: `update` fires at most once per frame with every channel in its final per-frame state, and `stop` always lands after that frame's final `update`. `settled` and reduced motion compose channel-wise.

Shapes are validated at compile time too (the `Shape` type — interfaces like your own `Vector2` work without index signatures): non-numeric, optional, or `undefined`-typed channels are rejected where they're declared.

Configs apply per channel. Pass a single `SpringDefinition` for every channel, or a shape mirroring the value with configs (or `null` to revert) at any level — a config at a subtree covers every channel below it:

```ts
spring.config = { position: stiff, opacity: defineSpring({ duration: 300, dampingRatio: 1 }) }
```

Configs are `SpringDefinition` instances — build them with `defineSpring`. Unlike the scalar `useSpring` above, config positions here don't accept bare option objects: a plain object is always a per-channel shape, so any non-config leaf it reaches throws with its path.

Spring objects chain channel-wise. Assign another spring object of the exact same shape, and a partial numeric target detaches only the channels it names:

```ts
follower.target = leader
```

## Reduced motion

Coily respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by default. When it's active, springs snap to their targets instead of animating: retargets and value writes apply instantly, and velocity impulses are ignored. Events stay coherent — one `update` per change, no `start`/`stop`, and `settled` resolves immediately — so code written against the animated path keeps working.

Control it with the `reducedMotion` system option: `'user'` (default — follow the OS setting, including live changes, which finish in-flight animations instantly), `'always'`, or `'never'`. Read `system.reducedMotion` to gate purely decorative effects (particles, flourishes) in your own code.

## Vue

Call `useSpringSystem()` once near the root of your app. It returns the spring system provided by this component or an ancestor; if none exists, it creates one, provides it to descendants, and starts/stops it with the component lifecycle. It's idempotent, and options apply only when a system is actually created:

```ts
import { useSpringSystem } from 'coily/vue'

const system = useSpringSystem() // e.g. read system.reducedMotion to gate decorative effects
```

(`provideSpringSystem(system, app?)` remains for plugging in a system you created yourself — mostly useful in tests. You manage `start()`/`stop()` for it.)

Then animate anywhere below:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useSpring } from 'coily/vue'

const target = ref(0)
const x = useSpring(target, { duration: 500, bounce: 0.3 })
</script>

<template>
  <div class="ball" :style="{ translate: `${x}px 0` }" @click="target = 300" />
</template>
```

`useSpring` returns a `SpringRef`: a writable ref of the animated value with `velocity`, `isResting`, and `timeRemaining` refs plus `jumpTo()` attached. The target can be a ref, a getter, or another `SpringRef` (which chains the springs). Options are also reactive — swap configs and the spring reconfigures in place.

Numeric shapes work the same way: pass a record or array (plain, ref, or getter) and get a `SpringObjectRef`. Reads are the deep-readonly composite value, writes take partial shapes, options accept reactive per-channel config shapes, and passing another `SpringObjectRef` follows it channel-wise. Deeply reactive targets retarget on nested mutation. For several _independent_ scalar springs, map over the targets — composables are loop-safe: `targets.map((t) => useSpring(t))`.

There's also a renderless `<SpringValue :target="n">` component exposing `{ value, velocity, isResting, timeRemaining, jumpTo }` through its default slot.

For imperative work — a dynamic set of springs created and disposed at arbitrary times (particles, per-item effects) — `useSpringPool()` returns `createSpring` bound to the provided system. Every spring created through the pool is disposed automatically when the component's scope is torn down, so leaked motions are structurally impossible; disposing a spring manually before that is fine.

## Nuxt

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['coily/nuxt'],
  coily: {
    debug: false, // debug logs active motion counts
    reducedMotion: 'user', // 'user' | 'always' | 'never'
  },
})
```

The module provides a spring system for the whole app (started on the client), auto-imports `useSpring`, `useSpringSystem`, `useSpringPool`, and `defineSpring`, and registers the `SpringValue` component.

## Timing

The built-in ticker advances springs once per displayed frame, so motion is as smooth as the screen it runs on — 60Hz, 120Hz, or adaptive sync. The loop sleeps while every spring is at rest (an idle system schedules no frames) and wakes on the next write. Set `fps` (option/property) to cap the rate; caps are paced to whole display frames, and each tick still receives the true elapsed time. Large frame gaps — e.g. returning from a backgrounded tab — are clamped via `lagThreshold` (default 500ms) and `adjustedLag` (default 33ms), so springs don't teleport. For manual stepping, skip `system.start()` and call `system.advance(dtMs)` yourself.
